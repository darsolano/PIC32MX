 * Processor:       PIC32

 * MPLAB XC32 uses two part default linker script file. See C32 User's
 * guide to understand the structure of default linker script file.
 *
 * For simple changes such as changing memory allocation and defining
 * a new memory section, only procdef.ld file needs modification.
 * Steps required to customize procdef.ld file are:
 *
 * 1. Depending on the processor you are using, copy the procdef.ld file
 *    from <xc32-install-path>/pic32mx/lib/proc/<processor> directory into
 *    your MPLAB X project directory.
 * 2. Modify the file as per your requirements.
 * 3. Rebuild your project.
 *
 * See procdef.ld in ../ directory to learn how changes can be made.
